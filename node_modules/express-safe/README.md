# express-safe Security Middleware

The `express-safe` middleware enhances the security of your Express application by blocking requests containing certain keywords and patterns commonly used in SQL injection attacks, XSS attacks, and other malicious activities.

## Security Logic

The middleware function includes the following security logic:

- Block requests containing SQL injection attack patterns.
- Block requests containing XSS attack patterns.
- Block requests containing other malicious patterns.

## Installation

You can install this package via npm:

```bash
npm install express-safe --save
```

## Usage

To use this middleware in your Express application, simply require it and use it like any other middleware:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const safe = require('express-safe');

const app = express();

app.use(safe({
  keywords: ['<script>', 'alert', 'onerror'], // Add custom keywords
  sendText: "Access is denied.", // Text returned when a request is blocked
  frameOption: 'SAMEORIGIN' // Method to prevent clickjacking
}));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('The server is running on <http://localhost:3000>');
});
```

### Custom Keywords

You can customize the blocked keywords and patterns by passing a configuration object:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const safe = require('express-safe');

const app = express();

// Global interception
app.use(safe({
  keywords: ['.zip', '.sql']
}));

// Global interception
app.get('/',safe(), (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
   console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

## Notes

- Ensure that this middleware is placed before all other middlewares to apply the security logic before processing requests.

- This middleware provides basic security protection. You may need to further customize and enhance it based on your application's specific requirements.
